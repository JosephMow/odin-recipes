  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a medium saucepan add beef, 1/4 cup soy sauce, oyster sauce, 
      brown sugar, garlic, ginger, star anise and half the beef stock. 
      Bring to a boil, regularly skimming impurities off the top, and 
      simmer, uncovered, for 1 ¼ to 1½ hours or until the beef is 
      tender and liquid reduced and thickened. Drain off most of the 
      liquid and set meat aside, covered with foil to keep warm. Shred 
      meat once cool enough to handle.
    </li>
    <li>In a large saucepan add remaining beef stock, 1 cup (250ml) 
      water, miso paste, remaining soy, mushrooms, pak choy and snow peas. 
      Heat over medium-low, covered, for 5 minutes or until pak choy and 
      snow peas are tender.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cook eggs for 4 to 5 minutes in a medium saucepan of 
      simmering water. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of 
      cold water. Once cool enough to handle peel eggs and cut into 
      halves.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the same pan of boiling water cook noodles according to packet 
      instructions. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Divide noodles among bowls and ladle miso soup and vegetables over 
      the top. Add beef mixture and eggs to bowl. Serve sprinkled with 
      sesame seeds, coriander, chilli and Sriracha sauce, if desired.
    </li>
  </ol>
